Frequently Asked Questions
1. I am having trouble adding the ‘manifest’ XML file to the excel sheet (I am working on my desktop, not on the web as we have MS365 installed on office computers)? Currently only the web version of this app has been released. The project template can be opened and customized on the desktop but the App is web based.

2. I uploaded the manifest file but I don't see the add-in? On the Home ribbon, try switching between single line ribbon to classic ribbon view or click the ... at the right of the ribbion.

3. ProjectProdigy stopped working. What should I do?. Clear your browsing data and reinstall the ProjectProdigy add-in.
